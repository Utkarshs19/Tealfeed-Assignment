How to run 

  Clone the Repository

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:
      git clone <repository_url>
      Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

  Navigate to the Project Directory
  
    Change directory to the cloned project:
      cd <project_directory>
      Replace <project_directory> with the name of your project directory.

  Install Dependencies
  
    Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm:
      npm install
        This command installs all dependencies listed in the package.json file.

  Run the React Application
  
    After the dependencies are installed, start the React application:
      npm start
      This command runs the React development server. It will compile the React code, launch a local server, and open your default web browser to view the application.
